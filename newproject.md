## Adding a Project to VFPX

The project proposal process is fairly simple and designed to reduce administrative overhead for all involved. All you have to do us fill out a two-page [VFPX Project Proposal](VFPXProjectProposalTemplate.dot) which provides the VFPX Administrators information needed to determine if the project fits into VFPX. Once you fill out the proposal, send the document to: projects AT vfpx DOT org.  

The administrators will review the proposal and let you know if it will be included or not included. The review process time varies depending on how busy the administrators are when you submit the proposal. After all, they all have day jobs too, just like you.

Once a project is accepted into VFPX, the project manager will be notified by one of the VFPX Administrators with the good news. The project manager then needs to decided if they really want to move forward and make the project a VFPX project.

Please understand that by making the project a VFPX project, the project managers (and the developers or other owners) are giving up any and all copyrights of the source code and accept the open/shared source licensing dictated by VFPX. This is your last chance to back out, once acceptance is made and the news release and project have been posted to the VFPX site it becomes part of VFPX.

The project manager also must decide whether the project will be under the VFPX repository (that is, github.com/VFPX/*ProjectName*) or in its own repository (that is, github.com/*ProjectManager*/*ProjectName*) but listed in the VFPX projects list.

What happens next depends on whether the project is under the VFPX repository or in its own repository.

## Under the VFPX repository
Once the project manager has confirmed that they want to go ahead with the project and that it should be under the VFPX repository, the following steps get the project started:

* The project manager sends the VFPX Administrator their GitHub ID so they can be added as a collaborator for the project on GitHub.
* The VFPX Administrator creates a new GitHub repository under VFPX for the project, adds the project manager as a colloborator for the project, and sends the project manager the URL for the repository.
* The VFPX Administrator creates a post about the project on the VFPX site to promote the new project.
* The VFPX Administrator adds the project to the [VFPX project list](https://vfpx.github.io/projects/).
* The project manager creates a Git repository on their machine for the source code (if not already done), including a README.md file which describes the project, and pushes it to the GitHub repository for the project.

## Its own repository
Once the project manager has confirmed that they want to go ahead with the project and that it should be in its own repository, the following steps get the project started:

* The project manager sends the VFPX Administrator the link for the GitHub repository for the project.
* The VFPX Administrator creates a post about the project on the VFPX site to promote the new project.
* The VFPX Administrator adds the project to the [VFPX project list](https://vfpx.github.io/projects/).

It is up to the project manager to determine the resource needs, who is working on the project, who is working on what aspects of the project,
and how to manage the source code control and releases. If the project manager needs any advice or want to bounce ideas off someone outside of the immediate team, please feel free to ask any of the VFPX Administrators.
