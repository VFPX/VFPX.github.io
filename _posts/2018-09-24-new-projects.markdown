There are two new VFPX projects available.

The new [DBC Low Level Functions](https://github.com/VFPX/DBCLowLevelFunctions) project is a library for reading and writing values of all properties and objects without opening a database with OPEN DATABASE.

The new [Log4VFP](https://github.com/VFPX/Log4VFP) project provides a VFP wrapper for the Log4NET diagnostic logging library, allowing you to easily add advanced logging features to your applications.
