There are two new projects from Irwin Rodr√≠guez. [FoxStack](https://github.com/Irwin1985/FoxStack) provides a stack class which models and implements a stack data structure in Visual FoxPro. [FoxStringBuilder](https://github.com/Irwin1985/FoxStringBuilder) is a project that creates a mutable sequence of characters, similar to the StringBuilder class in .NET.
