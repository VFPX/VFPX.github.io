As you may know, Matt Slay passed away in 2021. He was a great contributor to the Fox community and VFPX and will be greatly missed.

The last collaboration between Matt and Jim Nelson is [Object Explorer](https://github.com/VFPX/ObjectExplorer), which provides an explorer form to view members of the specified object.
