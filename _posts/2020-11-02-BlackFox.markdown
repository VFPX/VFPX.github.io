Another new project from Irwin Rodr√≠guez: [BlackFox](https://github.com/Irwin1985/BlackFox). This interesting project allows you to write code for modern language constructs, such as JSON notation and HTTP protocol, using a Visual FoxPro-like syntax. The technique alone is interesting: simply storing a command to a property of _SCREEN parses and executes it. In a way, it provides the ability to extend the VFP language.
