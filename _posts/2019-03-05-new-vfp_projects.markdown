The new [FoxMock](https://github.com/cwollenhaupt/foxmock) project is a mocking framework for Microsoft Visual FoxPro created by Christof Wollenhaupt. FoxMock is best used together with unit test tools like [FoxUnit](https://github.com/VFPX/FoxUnit). With FoxMock, you can define objects in your test code using a fluent interface without having to define test specific classes in a separate place.
