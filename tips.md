## Information for Project Managers  

### Logos

You can add [VFPX logos](/logos/index.html) to your source code, project Wiki page, your web site, etc.

### Tips

This is a work in progress so feel free to add your own notes or comments that you believe will helpful to other project managers on VFPX.

*   **Create a README.md file for your project**: Important information to include would be
    *   Your name and contact information
    *   A brief description of your project
    *   Instructions on how to join the project
*   **Convert binary files to their text equivalents**: Use [FoxBin2PRG](https://github.com/fdbozzo/foxbin2prg), [Alternate SCCText](https://github.com/VFPX/AlternateSCCText), [SubFox](https://github.com/VFPX/SubFox), or a similar program to convert VFP binary files, such as VCXs and SCXs, to text files so changes can be seen visually and merged together.
*   **Thor updater**: If you want your project to be available for download through Thor, see the [VFPX Deployment Project](https://github.com/VFPX/VFPXDeployment) for a tool to automate the process. Matt Slay's blog post <a href="http://mattslay.com/how-thor-checks-and-distributes-new-versions-of-tools-in-foxpro/" target="_blank">How Thor Checks And Distributes New Versions Of Tools In FoxPro</a> has a great background on the Thor update process.
