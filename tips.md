## Information for Project Managers  

### Migrating from CodePlex

If you currently have a VFPX project on CodePlex, we have [detailed instructions](/migrating/index.html) to migrate it to GitHub.

### Logos

You can add [VFPX logos](/logos/index.html) to your source code, project Wiki page, your web site, etc.

### Tips

This is a work in progress so feel free to add your own notes or comments that you believe will helpful to other project managers on VFPX.

*   **Create a README.md file for your project**: Important information to include would be
    *   Your name and contact information
    *   A brief description of your project
    *   Instructions on how to join the project
*   **Convert binary files to their text equivalents**: Use [FoxBin2PRG](https://github.com/fdbozzo/foxbin2prg), [Alternate SCCText](https://github.com/VFPX/AlternateSCCText), [SubFox](https://github.com/VFPX/SubFox), or a similar program to convert VFP binary files, such as VCXs and SCXs, to text files so changes can be seen visually and merged together.
